.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.P
Sometimes you want to have the output of a program send to a channel or
conference the bot is participating in, for example logfiles (if they dont
accumulate too fast). JSONBOT provides a plugin that can do this with the
use of UDP packets send to the bot. This program is the client part and can
be used to send txt pipelined into it to a UDP port on the listening bot.
This bot will then forward the txt to the channel provided with the -p,
--printto option.
