    "bad-namespace-prefix": "the entity has sent a namespace prefix that is unsupported, or has sent no namespace prefix on an element that requires such a prefix (see XML Namespace Names and Prefixes).",
    "conflict": "the server is closing the active stream for this entity because a new stream has been initiated that conflicts with the existing stream.",
    "connection-timeout": "the entity has not generated any traffic over the stream for some period of time (configurable according to a local service policy).",

    "not-authorized": "the entity has attempted to send data before the stream has been authenticated, or otherwise is not authorized to perform an action related to stream negotiation; the receiving entity MUST NOT process the offending stanza before sending the stream error.",

    "see-other-host": "the server will not provide service to the initiating entity but is redirecting traffic to another host; the server SHOULD specify the alternate hostname or IP address (which MUST be a valid domain identifier) as the XML character data of the <see-other-host/> element.",
    "system-shutdown": "the server is being shut down and all active streams are being closed.",
